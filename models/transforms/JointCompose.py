    Please, see the note below.

    Args:
        transforms (list of ``Transform`` objects): list of transforms to compose.

    Example:
        >>> transforms.Compose([
        >>>     transforms.CenterCrop(10),
        >>>     transforms.ToTensor(),
        >>> ])

    .. note::
        In order to script the transformations, please use ``torch.nn.Sequential`` as below.

        >>> transforms = torch.nn.Sequential(
        >>>     transforms.CenterCrop(10),
        >>>     transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406), (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)),
        >>> )
        >>> scripted_transforms = torch.jit.script(transforms)

        Make sure to use only scriptable transformations, i.e. that work with ``torch.Tensor``, does not require
        `lambda` functions or ``PIL.Image``.
